# Thesis
Data and matlab code for the MSc Thesis

- Beam data - In this folder, there is the percentage beam power simulation data for ray-tracing (+ FEM prediction if available)
- Zero-order model - In this folder, there are all the code files needed to run the zero-order model by itself
- FEM model - Same as zero-order model concept but for the FEM model
- Optimization - Here are the optimization tools used for the case study in the thesis: both zero-order model and FEM model components are needed but in this file there is everything.
- Experimental Data - nitrogen runs experimental data as well as code for data treatment and expected values calculation
