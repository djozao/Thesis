overall_efficiency parametric sweeps the diameter and length and calculates parameters such as efficiency and equilibrium temperatures
it uses the zero-order model and runs the transient analysis to get to the equilibrium temperature
- air + convectionloss is for the convection losses
- nistdata + nitrogen is for the propellant properties
- singlephase_linear_duct calculates the heat transfer to the propellant
