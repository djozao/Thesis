optimize_eq_temp and optimize_eq_temp_FEM are the optimization tools, they run an optimization algorithm with the CalcEqTemp files
models + air + convectionloss + fractionpower + gebhart are used to calculate the temperature according to the tools developed
nitrogen + nistdata gets the nitrogen properties
plot_x files plot the distribution along the nodes
plot_eq_temp and plot_eq_temp_FEM are used to plot the parametric sweep to confirm the optimization local maximum
T_eq_*geometry*_condition are used to calculate the temp in FEM.
