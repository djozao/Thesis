data_reader_X calculates the results for the X run

first the mass flow is calculated, then the pressure,
then the voltage difference between on and off thrust scenarios
which calculates the generated thrust

then with the experimental data the expected values are calculated

the pressure drop is calculated as well and applied to the previous for the expected values calculation
then the discharge coefficient + nozzle flow quality
