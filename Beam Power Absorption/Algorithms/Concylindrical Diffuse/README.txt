- run main absorption with the selected node setup desired to calculate the % absorbed with a parametric sweep
n1 = top surface and n2 = lateral surface and n3 = conical bottom surface
- "concyl_fem_absorbed" calculates the % that is absorbed for a certain geometry
- "Gebhart_3D_Concyl" calculates the B_ij matrix for a certain geometry
- "Fraction_power_matrix_3D_ConCyl" calculates how much % of the incoming power hits a certain node region
